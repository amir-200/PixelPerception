# PixelPerception
A TensorFlow-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that classifies 32x32 pixel images (e.g., cats, dogs, cars, planes). The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer, improving accuracy from 35% to 80%. Ideal for learning and experimenting with deep learning and image recognition tasks.
